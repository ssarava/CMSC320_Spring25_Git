Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a version control system that helps track changes, collaborate with others, and manage projects. It allows us to work on different parts of a project simultaneously through branches, keeps a backup of our work, and makes it easier to revert to previous versions. It's flexible, efficient, and widely used in both solo and team development.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: A field that data science can be applied to is healthcare. In healthcare, data science can be used to predict patient outcomes, optimize treatments, and personalize care plans. For example, by using machine learning algorithms to analyze medical records, doctors can predict the likelihood of diseases such as diabetes or heart conditions in patients based on their history and lifestyle data.
