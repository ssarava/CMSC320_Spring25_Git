Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git is a version control system that helps track changes, collaborate with others, and manage projects. It allows us to work on different parts of a project simultaneously through branches, keeps a backup of our work, and makes it easier to revert to previous versions. It's flexible, efficient, and widely used in both solo and team development.
